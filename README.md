# Fallen Heroes Memorial Project ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

A Python script that automatically honors fallen service members by posting their photos and detailed information to Facebook daily using GitHub Actions.

## Overview

- **Comprehensive Search**: Searches across multiple years for service members who died on the current date
- **Detailed Profiles**: Extracts detailed information including rank, unit, hometown, and circumstances
- **Photo Processing**: Downloads and optimizes photos for Facebook posting
- **Respectful Presentation**: Creates detailed captions honoring each service member
- **Rate Limiting**: Implements proper delays to respect API limits
